Bike Share Analysis Udacity 

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, we will look at bike share data and compare the cities: New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC. We will explore the following questions:
--Which city has the highest number of trips? Which city has the highest proportion of trips made by subscribers? Which city has the highest proportion of trips made by short-term customers?
--Bike-share systems are designed for riders to take short trips. Most of the time, users are allowed to take trips of 30 minutes or less with no additional charges, with overage charges made for trips of longer than that duration. What is the average trip length for each city? What proportion of rides made in each city are longer than 30 minutes?
--Dig deeper into the question of trip duration based on ridership. Choose one city. Within that city, which type of user takes longer rides on average: Subscribers or Customers?
-- Use the parameters of the `.hist()` function to plot the distribution of trip times for the Subscribers in your selected city. Do the same thing for only the Customers. Add limits to the plots so that only trips of duration less than 75 minutes are plotted. As a bonus, set the plots up so that bars are in five-minute wide intervals. For each group, where is the peak of each distribution? How would you describe the shape of each distribution?
